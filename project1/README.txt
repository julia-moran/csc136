Program Specifications:

You are to write a program that will help the local aquarium keep track of their bottlenose dolphins and
loggerhead sea turtles. For each animal, you are to store the following characteristics:
• Name – a string that may contain spaces
• Animal – D for dolphin or T for turtle
• Gender – F or M

The animal characteristics should be stored in two arrays; one will be a 2D array.
The program must read from a file into the arrays. You will have to create a file to test your program. The file
should contain three lines for each animal: the first line being the animals name, the second the animal type (a
character) and the third line will be the animal’s gender (a character). The file should not contain any blank
lines.

The program must do the following:
• Read all animal information from a text file into two arrays.
• Provide a menu to the user with options for searching, print by animal type or print all.
• Searching will allow the user to search for an animal by name; the program should then print that
  animal’s information.
• Print by animal type will print all the animals of the entered type (dolphin or turtle). This output must be
  in a nicely formatted table form.
• Print all will print all the animals at the aquarium sorted by name. This output must be in a nicely
  formatted table form.
