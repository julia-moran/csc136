Program Specifications:

You are to re-write program #1 utilizing the supplied class. You will be provided the class header file and class
implementation object code. You will write the driver (application) program that provides the same
functionality as program #1. It will help the local aquarium keep track of their bottlenose dolphins and
loggerhead sea turtles. For each animal, you are to store the following characteristics: Name (a string that will
not contain spaces), Species (D for dolphin or T for turtle), and Gender (F or M).

The program must read from a file into an array of objects. You will have to create a file to test your program.
The file should contain three lines for each animal: the first line being the animals name, the second the animal
species and the third the animal’s gender. The file should not contain any blank lines.

The program must do the following:
• Read all animal information from a text file into an array of objects.
• Provide a menu to the user with options for searching, print by animal type or print all.
• Searching will allow the user to search for an animal by name; the program should then print that
  animal’s information.
• Print by animal type will print all the animals of the entered type (dolphin or turtle). This output must be
  in a nicely formatted table form.
• Print all will print all the animals at the aquarium sorted by name. This output must be in a nicely
  formatted table form.
